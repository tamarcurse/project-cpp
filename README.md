# low-level system application
This project is a low-level system application written in C, developed and tested on a Linux virtual machine. The application focuses on multi-threading, file handling, bitwise operations, and UDP-based communication, demonstrating strong command of systems programming concepts.

Key Features
Multi-threading: Implementation of concurrent processing using POSIX threads (pthread), enabling efficient task handling.

File Operations: Reading from and writing to files for data logging, configuration, and communication.

Bit Manipulation: Efficient use of bit-level operations for flags, encoding, and data packing.

UDP Communication: Use of the UDP protocol for lightweight, connectionless communication between components or external systems.

Technologies Used
C Programming Language

Linux OS (tested on virtual machine)

POSIX Threads

Sockets API for UDP networking

Standard Linux system calls and file I/O APIs

Design Goals
Lightweight, fast, and modular.

Designed for real-time or near-real-time scenarios.

Emphasis on clean, readable code and robust error handling.
